# Search-movies-using-Python---IMdBPY
Hello Guys. In this project we'll be making a program that allows us to search movies in IMDb using Python

This is a very simple program...

Step 1: Open PyCharm and create a new project. Give a name to it.         #If you don't know about PyCharm, watch this video:https://youtu.be/fK3pnWBY4Go
Step 2: Create a Python file and name it as 'app'
Step 3: Copy the code from GitHub and paste it in your app.py file
Step 4: Run the Program
Step 5: Type any movie name you want to search

Now we have successfully created a program that allows us to search for movies in IMDb.

Congratulations to eveyone who did this!
